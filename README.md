1.max_min_mean
Write a program that reads integers from standard input, and then prints the minimal value, the maximal value, and the average value.  Note that the average may not be an integer.  If the program encounters any input that is not an integer, it can just stop reading data and print the results it has so far. 

2.the second smallest integer


3.sum of digits
Write a function that takes an integer parameter n(which you can assumeto be positive, say of typesizet) and returns the sum of all base-10 digits ofn.  Forexample, on input1024, the return value should be7.  (Note:if you solved the exerciseabout  printing  integers  in  different  bases,  you  are  most  of  the  way  to  the  solution.)
